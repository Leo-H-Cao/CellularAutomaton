# Cell Society Design Plan
### Team 7
### Nolan Gelinas, Leo Cao, Zach Schrage


## Design Overview
We will need to design an application that can read in data from a file that represents a game type and the games initial state. We will then need to display a GUI that allows the user to see the progress of the game, control the game speed, pause/play the game, and modify the current game state.


## Design Details

Here is a graphical look at my design:
